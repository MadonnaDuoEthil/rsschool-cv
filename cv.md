## About
Hi! The idea of creating user friendly interfaces has been following me since I finished study Philosophy. Logic is my main and strong passion, that is why artificial languages seem clear and absolutely beautiful to me.

After some time of learning what programming is I ended up with an interest in web-development, specifically in front-end development. There are several reasons:

1. Creating something **new** and **useful**;
2. Making design **wholesome** and **interactive**;
3. Meeting challenges means **personal growth** (like, "wow, I've done it *by myself* !");
4. Being a user myself, I want to make the experience of site usage **easy, pleasant and convenient**.

*The Internet* is a big part of everyone's life and I am ready to properly and quickly explore it from all sides being *Front-End Developer*!

## Skills
*That's what I've already known*:
* HTML (BEM methodology, adaptive and responsive layout and ect.)
* CSS, LESS
* JavaScript (basics, ES6+, DOM)
* React JS (basics)

*That's what I'm learning:*

* Regex

*That's what I'm plannig to learn:*

## Code Examples
***The task (from "freecodecamp"):*** *Remove all falsy values from an array. Return a new array; do not mutate the original array.*
```
function bouncer(arr) {
  let copyArr = arr.slice();
  let resultArr = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < copyArr.length; i++) {
    if (Boolean(copyArr[i]) === true) {
      resultArr.push(copyArr[i]);
    }
  }
  return resultArr;
}
```
